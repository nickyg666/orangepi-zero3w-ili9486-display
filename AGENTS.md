# Workspace Rules

## Display / KMS Policy (CRITICAL — read before any display work)

This board (Orange Pi Zero 3W, sun60iw2) has three possible displays:

- **HDMI-A-1** (card0, sunxi-drm + sunxi-hdmi)
- **USB-C** (connected via `twi@7084000/husb311@22/connector` — a second DP/display path)
- **ILI9486 SPI panel** (card1, custom `ili9486` + `drm_mipi_dbi` modules, DRM minor 1, `fb0: ili9486drmfb`)

**Mandatory initialization order:**

1. **Always initialize HDMI and USB-C displays FIRST.** They are the primary displays
   and must be brought up before the SPI panel. Never add `no-sunxi-drm` or anything that
   tears down `sunxi-drm`/`sunxi-hdmi`, and never suppress the HDMI connector.
2. **Duplicate/mirror the first-initialized display onto the SPI panel.** The ili9486
   SPI display must always show a copy of whichever external display initialized first
   (HDMI or USB-C). Do not drive the SPI panel as an independent/orphan screen.
3. Never edit `/boot/orangepiEnv.txt` `overlays=`/`extraargs=` to disable sunxi-drm or
   force HDMI off. If you think you need to, you are wrong — re-read this file.

### Boot config invariants (must remain true)

- `overlays=ili9486` — the ili9486.dtbo must exist at
  `/boot/dtb-6.6.98-sun60iw2/allwinner/overlay/sun60i-a733-ili9486.dtbo` AND at
  `/boot/dtb/allwinner/overlay/sun60i-a733-ili9486.dtbo` (the ACTIVE path u-boot
  boot.scr uses — the dtb-6.6.98 one is the kernel-package copy; changes to the
  active overlay MUST go to /boot/dtb/allwinner/overlay/).
- `extraargs=fbcon=map:1` (NO `video=HDMI-A-1:d` — HDMI must be allowed to bind).
- `/etc/modules-load.d/ili9486.conf` must list `drm_mipi_dbi`, `ili9486`, `ads7846`
  (boot watchdog deletes it after 3 failed boots — restore it if missing).
- If a boot watchdog rollback marker exists (`/var/lib/ili9486-boot-count.rolled-back`),
  re-verify these invariants before assuming the machine is healthy.
- `scale = <1>` in the dtbo (native 480x320 panel; the DRM mode IS 480x320).
  `spi-max-frequency = <0x1e84800>` (32MHz — 40MHz glitched, do NOT retry).

### Failure history

1. **no-sunxi-drm overlay (2026-08-05)** — a session added `no-sunxi-drm` to `overlays=`
   to stop the mutter Wayland segfault. This VIOLATED the HDMI-first policy and would
   have permanently broken HDMI/USB-C. Reverted; the correct fix was moving the
   compositor off the SPI panel entirely (see Wayland below). NEVER disable sunxi-drm.
2. **40MHz SPI overclock** — glitched the panel; reverted to 32MHz. Hardware limit.
3. **Wrong overlay path** — dtbo changes went to /boot/dtb-6.6.98-sun60iw2/ which is
   NOT what u-boot loads. The ACTIVE dir is /boot/dtb/allwinner/overlay/.

## Current Architecture (2026-08-06)

The display stack is "virtual display + mirror":

- **X session (gdm) runs on HDMI only** (card0) — the SPI panel is NOT an X screen.
  Config: `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-lcd-modesetting.conf` (kmsdev card0, HDMI-1 at
  1280x720 via preferred modeline, `AccelMethod "none"`).
- **Xvfb :1** (`xvfb-virtual-display.service`) — virtual 1280x720 display, always
  present, used for headless GPU rendering when no HDMI is connected.
- **spi-mirror** (`spi-mirror.service` → `/usr/local/bin/spi-mirror-select.sh` →
  `/home/orangepi/spi-mirror`) — grabs the real X display root window (NOT :1 when
  HDMI is up), box-filters to 480x320, writes **XRGB8888 32bpp** (NOT RGB565 — that
  bug caused doubled images) into /dev/fb-lcd. Kernel shadow-diff pushes changed
  16x16 blocks over SPI. ~8fps.
- **Minecraft**: `minecraft/game-run.sh` auto-detects the live display (:0/:2/:1),
  runs PrismLauncher with `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.5
  MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null`. zink renders on the PowerVR GPU
  (GL→Vulkan); `MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw` forces Mesa's software-present fallback
  (XShmPutImage) because this X stack has NO DRI3 (glamor hangs on both card0 and
  card1 — hardware/driver lock, do not retry).
  - **Instances**: 26.1.2 (NeoForge, modded) and 26.2 (vanilla). 26.2 has a native
    Vulkan backend (`com/mojang/blaze3d/vulkan/*`, `PreferredGraphicsApi` enum:
    DEFAULT/OPENGL/VULKAN) selected via `options.txt` `preferredGraphicsBackend`.
  - **DO NOT select VULKAN on 26.2** — the native IMG ICD (`libVK_IMG.so`) cannot
    present on this stack: no DRI3 + 256x256 hard WSI cap (see docs/GPU.md), and
    `MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw` on the native path segfaults during swapchain creation
    (verified with vkpresent_test). Force `preferredGraphicsBackend:"opengl"` so it
    uses the proven zink path. Same for 26.1.2.
  - **Both instances tuned for the weak PowerVR**: windowed 854x480, maxFps 45,
    renderDistance 8, guiScale 1 (was 1920x1080 fullscreen / maxFps 120 → slideshow).
  - **26.2 (vanilla) BOOTS OFFLINE on the GPU** — confirmed 2026-08-06: java runs,
    `Backend library: LWJGL 3.4.1+2`, `Using graphics backend OpenGL, drivers 4.5
    (Core Profile) Mesa 23.2.1`, `Using graphics device: zink Vulkan 1.3 (PowerVR
    B-Series BXM-4-64 MC1 (IMAGINATION_PROPRIETARY))`, window "Minecraft 26.2"
    854x480 on :0, SPI mirror active, stable (vanilla has no NeoForge auth dep).
    Launch with `--offline orangepi`:
    `./PrismLauncher --launch 26.2 --offline orangepi` (env: MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink
    MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.5 MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw EGL_PLATFORM=x11 ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null).
  - 26.1.2 (NeoForge) requires a real MSA login (offline mode aborts with authlib
    401 during boot) — needs user to re-login to Mojang in PrismLauncher GUI.
  - Launch a specific instance: `minecraft/launch-detached.sh <instance>` (default 26.1.2).

### Wayland

Weston on :1 worked but was removed ("Make X the default"). Old mutter-on-SPI
segfault (g_str_has_prefix NULL on card0 HDMI disconnect) is moot — the panel no
longer runs a compositor. Do not reintroduce mutter on the SPI panel.

**Weston DRM-backend as a root service is a dead end for the real display
(2026-08-06).** Running weston 9 with `--backend=drm-backend.so --tty=1` as a
root systemd service works once (GPU compositor on DP-1, PowerVR renderer) but
has NO logind helper (`logind: cannot setup systemd-logind helper (-61), using
legacy fallback`). In legacy mode weston cannot re-train the eDP/DP link after a
monitor power-cycle: the connector flaps connected/disconnected and the signal
never comes back until reboot. gdm/Xorg (logind-managed) handles hotplug fine.
The one working run showed a grey desktop before power-cycling the monitor made
it permanent-black. Do NOT put weston on the primary display; keep gdm3.

### GPU research (gpu/)

Offscreen GPU rendering on the PowerVR **works and is fast**: `gpu/pvr_offscreen.c`
+ `gpu/bench.c` render GLES3 on the BXM-4-64 via GBM (renderD129 = 1800000.gpu —
the SPI panel is renderD128, do not confuse them) at **250fps @ 1920x1080**
with dma-buf export (`EGL_MESA_image_dma_buf_export` import-then-export path).
The client-side *presentation* surface story is the blocker: BSP EGL has no
Wayland platform, native IMG Vulkan has no `VK_KHR_wayland_surface`, and the
GBM→dmabuf→weston import path wedges weston (busy-spins in repaint) because the
BSP GBM reports modifier `0xffffffffffffff` for rendered buffers while weston
expects linear/tiled. Zink on system mesa reaches the PowerVR but fails swapchain
("could not create swapchain" — no wayland surface in the ICD).
PowerVR is driven ONLY by the vendor BSP stack in /usr/local (GLES/EGL-only).

### Touch / calibration

- ADS7846 touchscreen (`99-ads7846-calibration.conf`): `Floating "false"` (gnome-shell
  detaches it otherwise), TransformationMatrix identity, libinput Calibration Matrix
  from calibration.
- **Calibration**: `minecraft/calibration/calibrate-gui` — fullscreen crosshair GUI
  that waits indefinitely; touch & hold each corner on the PANEL. Reads real XI
  device range (65535) — the earlier bug was assuming 4095 (16x wrong scale, all
  touches collapsed to one corner). Saves profiles to
  `/home/orangepi/.config/touch-calib/{hdmi,fbcp}.{cal,ctm}`; apply via
  `/home/orangepi/touch-calib.sh apply hdmi|fbcp` or desktop shortcuts.
- `show-touches` — draws green crosshair where each touch lands (calibration check).
- Desktop shortcuts: `calibrate-touch-hdmi.desktop`, `calibrate-touch-fbcp.desktop`,
  `apply-touch-*.desktop`, `show-touches.desktop`.

## GPU driver provenance (open vs closed)

- **Kernel driver: OPEN SOURCE.** `pvrsrvkm.ko` (loaded, 22 refs) drives
  `1800000.gpu`. License `Dual MIT/GPL`, author "Imagination Technologies",
  DKMS source at `/usr/src/img-bxm-dkms-0.1.0-2` (the img-bxm Rogue services
  kernel module). This is Imagination's official open PowerVR kernel driver.
- **Userspace: CLOSED.** The `/usr/local` BSP stack (`libEGL/libGLESv2`,
  `dri/pvr_dri.so`, `libpvr_mesa_wsi.so`) is Imagination's proprietary Rogue
  user-mode driver (build path `/home/hongyaobin/workspace/gpu_src2/gpu_um_priv/
  img-bxm/linux/rogue/...`). It is NOT upstream mesa.
- **Upstream mesa does NOT support PowerVR B-series (BXM-4-64).** Mesa's open
  `powervr` gallium driver only covers older E-Series GPUs and is incomplete.
  There is no open userspace for BXE/BXM. So the GPU userspace cannot be
  open-sourced/replaced; the kernel side already is. Do not try to swap in
  upstream mesa for the userspace (the GLES-only BSP EGL is the only thing that
  drives it, see docs/GPU.md).

## Gotchas

- **Session display number moves** (:0 → :2 after Xvfb grabs :1, and back).
  Everything must auto-detect the display (game-run.sh, spi-mirror-select.sh),
  never hardcode :0.
- **Xorg dual-screen config (card0+card1 as two X screens) breaks input** — the
  mouse/touch gets trapped on the SPI screen. Keep SPI out of X entirely.
- **gdm XAUTHORITY**: `/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority` (user session) or
  `/run/user/127/gdm/Xauthority` (greeter). Check which is current.
- **PrismLauncher refuses root**; launch via `su - orangepi -c` (launch-detached.sh).
- **Stale prismlauncher processes** hold the instance lock; kill all + rm
  `instances/26.1.2/instance.lock` before relaunch.
- **libopenal segfaults** (SIGSEGV in `libopenal.so+0x9c670` EffectSlot mixer) with the
  LWJGL-bundled openal. `ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null` + config `drivers = null` do NOT fix it —
  the bundled openal crashes processing effect slots regardless. FIXED durably by
  **patching the natives jar**: replace
  `libraries/org/lwjgl/lwjgl-openal-natives-linux-arm64/3.4.1-lwjgl.1/...-3.4.1-lwjgl.1.jar`
  entry `linux/arm64/org/lwjgl/openal/libopenal.so` with
  `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libopenal.so.1.19.1` and update the `.sha1` (backup kept
  as `.bundled-bak`). LD_PRELOAD does NOT work (LWJGL re-extracts from jar each launch).
- **Offline launch (`--offline <name>`) crashes NeoForge** with `MinecraftClientHttpException
  Status: 401` at `YggdrasilUserApiService.fetchProperties` — NeoForge 26.x requires the
  Mojang auth service even for a valid session; offline mode aborts during boot.
  The game ONLY boots with a real MSA account (the account in accounts.json currently has
  `profileName: None` — needs re-login to Mojang). zink/GPU rendering is confirmed working
  up to the auth crash (all texture atlases created on PowerVR).
- **NeoForge early splash window kills zink** (needs GLX): `fml.toml`
  `earlyWindowControl = false`.
- **PowerVR native Vulkan ICD (libVK_IMG.so) enumerates but CANNOT present to
  windows** — no DRI3 on this X stack, 256x256 hard WSI swapchain cap, and the
  `MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw` software-present hack segfaults on the native path (only
  zink's sw-present works). Don't try to "fix" native Vulkan presentation; it is a
  driver/hardware limit. See docs/GPU.md.
- **Vulkan only lists PowerVR when the native ICD is the first device**; a plain
  `vulkaninfo` shows PowerVR BXM-4-64 MC1 (integrated) first, llvmpipe second.
  Rendering (offscreen/surfaceless) works; windowed present does not.
- **sudo**: `SUDO_ASKPASS=/home/orangepi/.opencode-askpass sudo -A <cmd>`. NOPASSWD rule
  at `/etc/sudoers.d/99-orangepi` (orangepi can sudo anything passwordless).
- **Heredocs via `sudo -A bash -c` eat $variables** — write files with the Write
  tool, or single-quote the heredoc delimiter.
- **`pkill -f "Xvfb :1"` from a root shell can hang the shell** (matches itself);
  use exact PIDs or `pkill -x`.

## Apt / OS version

- OS is **Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy** ("Orange Pi 1.0.0 Jammy"), kernel
  `6.6.98-sun60iw2` (vendor `linux-image-current-sun60iw2`). BSP GPU stack in
  /usr/local is NOT dpkg-managed.
- Sources: vendor `repo.huaweicloud.com/ubuntu-ports` (jammy, in sources.list) +
  official `ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports` added via
  `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu-ports.sources` (jammy suites, same components).
  Both reachable; `apt-get update` works (125MB).
- **DO NOT `do-release-upgrade` to 24.04/26.04** — the vendor kernel
  (`sun60iw2`) and PowerVR BSP stack are built for Jammy; 10 vendor packages
  (`linux-image-current-*`, `linux-headers-current-*`, orangepi-*) would break on
  Noble, and the board's DRM/display + SPI panel rely on the vendor kernel + dts
  overlays. 26.04 has no arm64 vendor support. Keep Jammy.
